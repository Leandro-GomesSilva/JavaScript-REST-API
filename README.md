 The 9th project on the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This is REST API built with Express that provides a way to manage a school database, which contains information about users and courses.
 
  Main technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js<br>
  Auxiliary technologies: SQL, Sequelize ORM<br>
  Complexity level: Intermediate<br>

## For "Exceeds Requirements":
  - E-mail address validation and constraint (valid and unique)
  - Some attributes are filtered out of the response
  - Users POST route handles a Sequelize Constraint Error
  - PUT and DELETE routes ensures that authenticated user is indeed the course's owner
